# Text-Game

When I was first learning how to code, I decided it would be a good idea to make a text adventure game that is played in the terminal. This resulted in some of the worst code I have ever seen. If you download and run this, it might work. If you make certan decisions it may put you into an infinate loop. If you read the actuial code you will certantly become unreasonably angry. Don't say I didn't warn you.
